# save_the_animals-project

Project Objective:

The objective of the project is to create a system that can register all animals by type (canine, feline, etc.), and for this purpose, it is a requirement to be able to dynamically add new types. The animals need to be classified by approximate age, color, size, and any specific characteristics they may have. Additionally, the system should include a registration of people interested in adoption, containing their main contact details and the species they are interested in adopting. When choosing a species, the user should also be able to specify any preferences they have for the animal. Finally, at the end of each month, the municipality will generate a report matching available species with potential candidates, or when an adoption candidate calls, the attendant should be able to search for any animals with the specified characteristics.
